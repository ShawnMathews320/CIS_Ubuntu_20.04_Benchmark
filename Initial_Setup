1.1 Filesystem Configuration
- Directories used for system wide functions should be placed on separate partitions for further protection.
- Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options.
- If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system.
- Note: If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data 
has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the 
directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old 
partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted.
